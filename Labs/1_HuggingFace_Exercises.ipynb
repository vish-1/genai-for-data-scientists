    "\n",
    "## Exercise 1: Downloading and Prompting T5\n",
    "- Objective: Familiarize yourself with the T5 model, download it using HuggingFace's transformers library, and use it for a simple task.\n",
    "- Tasks:\n",
    "    1. Install the HuggingFace `transformers` library.\n",
    "    2. Import the necessary modules for T5.\n",
    "    3. Download the T5 model using the `transformers` library.\n",
    "    4. Write a function to prompt T5 with a simple translation task (e.g., translate a sentence from English to French).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 2: Transfer Learning with BERT\n",
    "- Objective: Understand the concept of transfer learning and apply it using the BERT model for a classification task.\n",
    "- Tasks:\n",
    "    1. Choose a dataset for a binary classification task (e.g., sentiment analysis).\n",
    "    2. Load the pre-trained BERT model from the HuggingFace library.\n",
    "    3. Fine-tune BERT on your chosen dataset for the classification task.\n",
    "    4. Evaluate the performance of your model on a test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 3: Distillation of T5-small ( Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Objective: Learn about model distillation and apply it to the T5-small model to create a smaller, more efficient version.\n",
    "- Tasks:\n",
    "    1. Understand the concept of model distillation.\n",
    "    2. Use the HuggingFace `transformers` and `distillation` libraries to distill BERT.\n",
    "    3. Compare the performance and size of the distilled model to the original BERT model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 4: Using ROUGE for Evaluation\n",
    "- Objective: Learn about the ROUGE metric and use it to evaluate a text summarization model.\n",
    "- Tasks:\n",
    "    1. Understand what the ROUGE metric is and its importance in NLP.\n",
    "    2. Choose a text summarization model from HuggingFace's library.\n",
    "    3. Summarize a set of documents using this model.\n",
    "    4. Evaluate the summaries using the ROUGE metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 5: Exploring BLEU for Machine Translation\n",
    "- Objective: Learn about the BLEU metric and use it to evaluate a machine translation model.\n",
    "- Tasks:\n",
